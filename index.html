            A few years ago, the idea of becoming an engineer was unimaginable for me. 
            I liked math and computers, but the idea of working with them did not <i>click</i> 
            for me yet. After an introductory course to C++ and a visit to Google Peru's 
            headquarters, I was sold. Few years later, here I am! Browse through my page and learn what I've done, I'm doing, and will do.
